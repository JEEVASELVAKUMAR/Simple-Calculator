 Simple Calculator in Python
This is a basic calculator program written in Python. It takes two numbers and an operator from the user, then performs the chosen operation.

ðŸ’¡ How it Works
Input from User:

The program first asks the user to enter two numbers (num1 and num2).

Then it asks the user to choose an operator (+, -, *, //, %).

Perform Operation:

Based on the operator entered, it performs the corresponding arithmetic operation:

+ for addition

- for subtraction

* for multiplication

// for floor division (gives the whole number part of the division)

% for modulus (gives the remainder)

Output the Result:

It prints the result of the operation.

If the user enters an invalid operator, it shows a message:
"Please enter a valid operator to perform operation on entered values."
